# Dog Adoption App Project
## A work in progress of my first app

This project presents my skills as a junior developer by meeting these requirements:
- building scrollable ui
- using local resources
- using network images
- intent outside of your app
- initiating email creation from your app
- giving user temporary feedback using the snackbar
- version control
